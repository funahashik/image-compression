# image-compression
This codes are Still-Image compression .\n
Following two folders are "Bit-Plane Coding" made in my youthfulldays(when I was Univercity Student). 
The technologies are very simple, context-based arithmetic coding(I use Range Coder) not using predictive error, filter-bank.
I think this apploach is very useful for fast compressed image searchig/data mining system with progressive decoding.
 (1):"BC_GrayScale" is to compress ~.pgm, I put test-image lennagray.pgm
 (2):"BC_Color" is to compress ~.ppm, I put test-image lenna.ppm
